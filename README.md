## Information about the app ##
This app is modeled after Facebook's chat. It allows messages to be sent between two users Laura and Rob. Laura's window is on the left, and Rob's is on the left. It shows the date at the beginning of a chat, and when a message is sent 11 minutes or more after the most recent message. When a user is typing, the other user's chat window indicates this.

This app was built using Create React App (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
